Borg Invasion 4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors' interaction with them and the audience. The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg's assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack. Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the \"surviving\" actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts. The shuttle launches but the Borg cube with the Queen inside captures it. As the Queen taunts the audience, the Borg are tearing the shuttle apart. Just as they are about to reach the audience, a familiar, charmingly raspy, friendly female voice is heard as well as the sound of proton torpedoes. She disagrees that resistance is futile and is there to prove it.","director":["Ty Granoroli"],"actors_names":["C.

Driving the stars of low-budget movies, along with their fragile egos, to and from locations in the middle of nowhere, pushes Don's buttons in all of the wrong directions. When Luke, the young and self-absorbed writer/director challenges Don's authority, murder and mayhem ensues. The movie's Scream Queen' starlet, Riversa Red, to her dismay finds herself the target of Don's obsession. With his encyclopedic knowledge of her \"body\" and body of work, Don worms his way onto Riversa's good side, no easy task. Not knowing whether to fear or friend Don, Riversa finds herself at the center of a cyclone with Luke and Don both vying for her attention. A mysterious Hotel Bellboy and an unknown \"watcher in the woods\" lend themselves to the growing suspense as the cast and crew hold-up at Forest Grove Lodge. After a couple of grueling days into the movie shoot, Don goes berserk, getting himself kicked off of the show. But letting go of Don doesn't come without a price. When he shows up the next day, 9 mm handgun in tow, the cast and crew are forced to act in Don's own home movie. Those who make a stand are dealt a deadly hand and those that await their fate wish they never stepped into the \"Star Vehicle\". Once the wheels of horror start rolling, there's no turning back.","director":["Ryan Nicholson"],"actors_names":["Dan Ellis","Nathan Durec","Nick Windebank","Sindy Faraguna"],"writers_names":["Ryan Nicholson"],"actors":[{"id":"7d023255-e805-4e00-a2f2-c2039adad560","name":"Nathan Durec"},{"id":"988f2cc2-dee1-490a-979a-8b01e4cfb73e","name":"Sindy Faraguna"},{"id":"d15b4c3d-e5ea-4a9a-9f87-b908d23ffb47","name":"Dan Ellis"},{"id":"ecf62f45-8e6d-4db3-b100-3660a9ac571c","name":"Nick Windebank"}],"writers":[{"id":"099eaf73-a50f-4b4a-9c0d-724574e1acb8","name":"Ryan Nicholson"}],"directors":[{"id":"099eaf73-a50f-4b4a-9c0d-724574e1acb8","name":"Ryan Nicholson"}]}}

He stops to watch a group of newsboys singing and dancing, and decides to organize them into the greatest kid act to ever hit vaudeville. Mary persuades Proctor, a big theatrical manager, to book the act, and they are a big hit. Then Larry and his publicity agent, \"Speed\" King, launch a big publicity stunt---a talent train in which they travel across country holding auditions for young performers. Back in New York, Carlotta Salvini, an ex-OPera singer, brings in her talented fourteen-year-old-daughter, Jane, who has an amazing voice. Larry, to get the mother out of the way, offers Carlotta a forty-week vaudeville tour, and then goes to work to make a star out of Jane, by building Braodway's first all-kiddie musical revue around her. Opening night has \"School Days\" as the first act and the show and Jane are a big hit...until the Gerry Society, organized to protect working children, reminds Larry there is a law against children working after 10 p m., and the show closes.

The latest incident in the feud is an on-field brawl between the players worse than they have ever had, which results in an indefinite suspension of both teams from the league pending a full investigation. Each game not played results in a loss and thus less and less chance of either team reaching the post-schedule championship. Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta's suspension, its owner/president, José Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, José, upon Philip's expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, Inês Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and Inês fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and Inês do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, Inês' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul's American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/Inês relationship being fraught with life long problems. As Paul and Inês' love deepens, so does the feud, the two which truly may be incompatible.","director":["Mark Heller"],"actors_names":["António Fonseca","Kyle Redmond-Jones","Neil Fluellen","Teresa Tavares"],"writers_names":["Neil Jackson","Tiago Santos"],"actors":[{"id":"1c6a3c3a-8394-42af-a691-ce875eba9798","name":"António Fonseca"},{"id":"6334f31b-a956-4059-ad48-3015e8f1ebed","name":"Teresa Tavares"},{"id":"87270fdc-c45b-4a74-83bb-893e9b31056e","name":"Neil Fluellen"},{"id":"c1308786-d9d5-4971-a908-ad4ed9f37757","name":"Kyle Redmond-Jones"}],"writers":[{"id":"1163951e-d74a-41b9-87a6-903eab9b17bc","name":"Tiago Santos"},{"id":"1eea962a-3264-4656-a91a-6c8e0e447205","name":"Neil Jackson"}],"directors":[{"id":"58006678-1c01-4278-afef-95fde3803122","name":"Mark Heller"}]}}

The Russian filmmaker, Pavel Klusjantsev, has had an extraordinary influence on an entire genre of films. Throughout his career at the film studio in St. Petersburg, Klushantsev pioneered and invented legendary techniques for filming the planets, stars and weightnessless - long before anyone else. He went on to redefine the science fiction genre and influence the way Hollywood made their science fiction films, including the Academy Award-winning Visual Effects Master, Robert Skotak, a man who spent years trying to track Klushantsev down. This is a film about a fantastic inventor and dreamer whose destiny was intimately linked with the Space Race and the whims of the Soviet dictatorship. However, despite dying blind and penniless, Klushantsev has left an indelible mark on the history of film and inspired countless filmmakers. The Star Dreamer ensures that the name of Pavel Klushantsev lives on.","director":["Mads Baastrup","Sonja Vesterholt"],"actors_names":["Pavel Klushantsev","Robert Skotak","Valerij Suslov","Zjanna Klusjantseva"],"writers_names":["Mads Baastrup","Sonja Vesterholt"],"actors":[{"id":"141ee6d2-7352-4c1a-bc5c-58f5de256e64","name":"Robert Skotak"},{"id":"2b9c6790-d8d0-4d97-a93c-79082bb63380","name":"Zjanna Klusjantseva"},{"id":"6ca64da9-80ec-4a74-ac71-fd874cbcdcef","name":"Valerij Suslov"},{"id":"b9c52ab2-4336-4ff8-9a4b-40272077902f","name":"Pavel Klushantsev"}],"writers":[{"id":"5f7856bf-0ab1-458b-9205-68a83b81b2dc","name":"Sonja Vesterholt"},{"id":"7aedcd92-a55e-43aa-aadb-d7330247c2ee","name":"Mads Baastrup"}],"directors":[{"id":"5f7856bf-0ab1-458b-9205-68a83b81b2dc","name":"Sonja Vesterholt"},{"id":"7aedcd92-a55e-43aa-aadb-d7330247c2ee","name":"Mads Baastrup"}]}}

When the nations of Earth refuse to surrender, Gamilon begins bombarding Earth with planet bombs, radioactive missiles that look like meteors, which gradually spread deadly radiation all over Earth, forcing what's left of humanity to retreat to underground cities. Queen Starsha of planet Iscandar contacts Earth and promises to provide Cosmo-DNA that can remove the radioactivity and restore Earth to beautiful life. She provides plans to an engine that will allow a brave, young group of technicians to journey more than a hundred thousand light-years to Iscandar, obtain the Cosmo-DNA, and return to Earth within one Earth year. In 2199, an ancient seagoing vessel is fitted with the awesome engine and launched toward Iscandar.

To secure this unique picture a Biograph camera was kept constantly at work by specially devised electric apparatus for weeks, during which time exposures were made every four minutes, 8 hours a day. Before the contractors began their work of tearing down and after the last vestige of the building had been removed, 15 seconds of exposure at normal speed were made. Thus in the finished positive one views at first the old Star Theatre standing as it had for years looking down with serenity upon the bustle of Broadway traffic. Then as if struck by a tornado of supernatural strength, the building begins to crumble. Chimneys totters, walls cave in, and whole stories vanish, until at last the site shows only a cellar excavation; and the Broadway cars with the sidewalk procession continue as if nothing unusual had happened. When this view is shown in the reverse, the effect is very extraordinary.","director":["Frederick S.

The manager called his press agent in, scolded him and ordered him to secure a vaudeville team, adding that \"they must be extremely funny and extremely cheap.\" Within a short time the agent returned and proudly announced he had found \"an absolute novelty, and a joint salary of $15.\" \"I dodged all the agencies,\" he explained, \"and down on one of the side streets I ran across an old-time ham actor. I followed him. He went into a laundry and tried to get his duds out without paying for them. Well, the woman who ran the joint was a regular comedy queen. She didn't say much, but she certainly was full of 'pep.' She nearly wrecked the laundry with that actor, and I never laughed so much in my life. When I offered them an engagement the man balked, but the woman accepted for both of them, saying he could work out his laundry bill anyhow.\" The manager tried the act out, and it made a big hit. The morning papers gave much space to the \"Soap Suds Star,\" Sophie, the laundress. Much to his dismay, however, the press agent found the manager in an extremely bad humor. \"It's all your fault,\" he said bitterly, \"You get me to hire amateurs, and now they are going to be married, and quit vaudeville for the classics.\" \"I think it a dandy idea,\" said the agent. \"Sophie as Juliet would coin money for any manager. Why not try them out in the balcony scene\" The manager, impressed, retained his \"Soap Suds Star,\" and his leading man. Sophie s bad temper, however, spoiled her artistic career. She was on the job as Juliet, all right, but Romeo nearly missed the performance, and when he did appear he wore his street clothes, explaining with an alcoholic smile that he had been out with the boys and really had no time to dress. Sophie left her art to chastise him, but after a lively chase he escaped by leaping into the river, and the one-time actress returned to her laundry, believing she was a widow. But her husband came back and Sophie forgave him. Then, finding that his clothes had been well sprinkled in the river, she ironed him out, and gave him a life position in the laundry.","director":[],"actors_names":["Carey L.

Meanwhile back on Tatooine, the evil Jabba the Hutt is causing trouble. He also has in his possession Han Solo, who's been frozen in carbonite in the last adventure, so in a land speeder, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca and Princess Leia rush to Jabba's palace. After a treacherous ride over cliffs and rocks, you arrive. Leia is dressed as bounty hunter Boush. You rescue Han Solo, then you must defeat Bib Fortuna, survive the Rancor pit, treacherous rides on Skiffs, and send Jabba the Hutt to an early grave! Soon after you all travel to the exotic moon of Endor, while Lando Calrissian leads Rebel pilots into a full scale attack on the Empire. Luke and Leia must survive a fast and furious Speeder rides, avoiding trees. Then they meet Wicket and the rest of the Ewoks who help rid the Ewok Village of Imperial Troops. Luke, meanwhile, heads into the forest and allows himself to be captured and taken onboard the Death Star where he must engage into a lightsaber battle with Darth Vader, and even the Emperor himself! And then, Lando flies the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star and destroys the breaking point, which is the good news because the Death Star will now simultaneously combust. The bad news: you've got to zoom out of there at the speed of light, avoiding walls and small ceilings! If you are successful, the Death Star will once and for all be blown away into the heavens, and the Rebels will live happily ever after.","director":["Kalani Streicher"],"actors_names":[],"writers_names":[],"actors":[],"writers":[],"directors":[{"id":"1419f2eb-37bb-43eb-b6d7-4867fc647830","name":"Kalani Streicher"}]}}

But when the lights came up, they all disappeared... Unless you had all the toys. In which case, the adventure never had to end. In backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped with great cunning out on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures. Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired them. Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys. Through interviews with former Kenner employees, experts, authors, and collectors, it looks at the toys' history, their influence, and the fond and fervent feelings they elicit today.","director":["Brian Stillman"],"actors_names":["John Booth","John Cook","Tom Beaumont","Tom Berges"],"writers_names":["Brian Stillman"],"actors":[{"id":"07b17dbd-e38e-4c30-b386-68b4f9c612e2","name":"Tom Beaumont"},{"id":"4992ca0b-bb8d-40de-8cfa-96a6c09c54af","name":"John Booth"},{"id":"89f79ca7-416d-4934-93d1-0289dbb4b4be","name":"Tom Berges"},{"id":"b2826894-a791-4278-bdae-7718b993cecb","name":"John Cook"}],"writers":[{"id":"2669a09b-1a32-481e-8adf-3f3e628f50bb","name":"Brian Stillman"}],"directors":[{"id":"2669a09b-1a32-481e-8adf-3f3e628f50bb","name":"Brian Stillman"}]}}

A planet from another solar system drifts into Earth's system and is detected by some Earth scientists who investigate. The surface of this planet is no longer habitable and the residents have moved to a high-tech underground city. The society is ruled by the women, who of course, are all beautiful. Men are considered mentally inferior and are divided into two categories: the \"adequately intelligent\" who are selected by women to act as their personal \"domestics\" for household chores, and the remainder who are forced to perform menial labor under the supervision of female guards. The guards are attired nicely in visored helmets, boots, hot pants, and elbow-length gloves which are used to control the men through some sort of apparent force. Scientists from Earth (one men and one woman) find their way to the planet, and are forced to take their stated places in society. The man is chosen as a domestic, sometimes is forced to work on a city maintenance crew, and the woman is assigned a white-collar job. The aliens also visit Earth clandestinely in their tear-drop shaped ship. Some episodes bluntly address the issue of unfair discrimination based on sex.","director":[],"actors_names":["Christiane Krüger","Christian Quadflieg","Judy Geeson","Lisa Harrow"],"writers_names":[],"actors":[{"id":"40437536-f7c2-4950-8f9a-eafeaaa1d60c","name":"Judy Geeson"},{"id":"8d74a75e-cf25-4d9f-8597-ffe30eaffc6f","name":"Christian Quadflieg"},{"id":"ec02bf6c-1f2a-47f4-8d0d-17cb93c5c513","name":"Lisa Harrow"},{"id":"ee07b835-6ae3-4007-a726-93c147b25270","name":"Christiane Krüger"}],"writers":[],"directors":[]}}

During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.","director":["Gene Feldman","Suzette Winter"],"actors_names":["Ben Cooper","Cliff Robertson","Diane Baker","Joan Crawford"],"writers_names":["Gene Feldman","Suzette Winter"],"actors":[{"id":"637a59c5-8bf8-4d2c-a092-d8c6440cd7ed","name":"Ben Cooper"},{"id":"6d3150e2-d4d6-4ece-a422-3908f79fed1a","name":"Joan Crawford"},{"id":"8ec0a939-8f05-4aff-b7ef-3da884569cad","name":"Diane Baker"},{"id":"a6c6787c-c77a-457e-b188-c43cb31cc15b","name":"Cliff Robertson"}],"writers":[{"id":"161238ad-17e7-4817-8ed8-7237eb93284d","name":"Suzette Winter"},{"id":"ff132925-05a2-40d9-8d37-7f67df4d6339","name":"Gene Feldman"}],"directors":[{"id":"161238ad-17e7-4817-8ed8-7237eb93284d","name":"Suzette Winter"},{"id":"ff132925-05a2-40d9-8d37-7f67df4d6339","name":"Gene Feldman"}]}}

His life changes when he meets Dorothy Stratten working behind the counter of a Dairy Queen. Dorothy is a pretty but naive high school senior. Paul immediately falls for Dorothy, who sees in Paul a wise, worldly person unlike herself. Paul believes Dorothy is Playboy material, the magazine he sees as only a springboard to bigger and better things. Paul's dream does become a reality: not only does Dorothy eventually marry him, she becomes the August 1979 Playboy Playmate and ultimately Playboy Playmate of 1979, which does indeed lead to the start of an acting career. As Dorothy's star rises, Paul's life is one of a hanger-on as those in Dorothy's new circle, including Playboy publisher Hugh M. Hefner and movie director Aram Nicholas, don't much like Paul. Paul is unable to eke out a life of his own without using Dorothy's name, which she increasingly is reluctant to provide to her husband. Those that know the couple know their relationship cannot continue as is, and it's only a matter of how it will change or end is the question.","director":["Bob Fosse"],"actors_names":["Carroll Baker","Cliff Robertson","Eric Roberts","Mariel Hemingway"],"writers_names":["Bob Fosse","Teresa Carpenter"],"actors":[{"id":"451937f2-6d4d-4193-b5f3-90d054a1ca32","name":"Eric Roberts"},{"id":"84ce7fac-3601-42a6-a69b-da82fcacd3dd","name":"Mariel Hemingway"},{"id":"a6c6787c-c77a-457e-b188-c43cb31cc15b","name":"Cliff Robertson"},{"id":"c7edc3ef-8ae8-4fb2-9999-e33a96ef48ba","name":"Carroll Baker"}],"writers":[{"id":"14735c75-9ebc-4602-8363-21527b6cc25a","name":"Teresa Carpenter"},{"id":"ca0c00e3-9529-4a12-a27d-55d862f7b97b","name":"Bob Fosse"}],"directors":[{"id":"ca0c00e3-9529-4a12-a27d-55d862f7b97b","name":"Bob Fosse"}]}}

The Jedi Order is reestablished on the planet Yavin 4, and has continued to train new Jedi Knights in the art of peace and justice. But all is not peaceful in this new world. With the fall of the Dark Empire, the ancient Skenvi Empire now comes out of the shadow to make its move. The Skenvi now oppose the New Republic for control over the galaxy with their aggressively growing empire. The Skenvi seek to seize control of all the galaxy's most valuable resources to cripple their enemies. And if a planet refuses to join them, they have been known to take very aggressive actions. Caught in between this struggle over the fate of the galaxy is the little planet of Coreign. The planet possesses a very powerful resource that would greatly favor the side that has access to it if a galactic war was to emerge. In its eagerness to gain access to Coreign's resources, the Skenvi Empire sends its most infamous negotiator, Lord Siege. He is a man who is known throughout the galaxy for seeing that the Skenvi Empire gets what it wants by all means necessary. The New Republic sends two of its Jedi ambassadors, Master Soran Darr and his padawan, Raven Darkham.","director":["Rasmus Tirzitis"],"actors_names":["Carolina Neurath","Karl Lindqvist","Patrik Hont","Stephanie Douglas Anderberg"],"writers_names":["Jeffrey Long","Matthew Davis","Michael Banno","Rasmus Tirzitis","Steven Parker"],"actors":[{"id":"8a1bb4d2-ee73-4329-b62f-f55509b117d2","name":"Carolina Neurath"},{"id":"b0c5c419-73bf-436f-9fcd-68d7d6e9b0a1","name":"Patrik Hont"},{"id":"bc6bf2fe-cbf9-46ae-94b5-84ed663f4371","name":"Karl Lindqvist"},{"id":"c9584484-4585-42f1-8e30-e2b5f4993dbe","name":"Stephanie Douglas Anderberg"}],"writers":[{"id":"08b369d9-5448-4def-83e3-33bde45cf261","name":"Michael Banno"},{"id":"5398f5f8-23cc-453c-ace3-55e93f84e27c","name":"Steven Parker"},{"id":"53eae1dd-a82b-4561-817c-4732e06a0226","name":"Matthew Davis"},{"id":"58ed700d-4e64-49cd-a89f-b858d9bd399c","name":"Rasmus Tirzitis"},{"id":"f5897024-673d-448c-96af-f6eeb859fb65","name":"Jeffrey Long"}],"directors":[{"id":"58ed700d-4e64-49cd-a89f-b858d9bd399c","name":"Rasmus Tirzitis"}]}}

When he finds that Morg was a sheriff for a long time before he became a bounty-hunter, he asks the older man to teach him. Morg thinks that being a sheriff is a foolish goal, but agrees to instruct Ben in handling people, more important to a sheriff than handling a gun.","director":["Anthony Mann"],"actors_names":["Anthony Perkins","Betsy Palmer","Henry Fonda","Michel Ray"],"writers_names":["Barney Slater","Dudley Nichols","Joel Kane"],"actors":[{"id":"035bc2f6-05d3-42a0-b820-bdea903ada05","name":"Betsy Palmer"},{"id":"6d632920-025b-4e66-aae0-9ba6abaf648c","name":"Anthony Perkins"},{"id":"ca283661-e10a-49d7-958c-164782cb351c","name":"Henry Fonda"},{"id":"e2fb90a8-45c5-4dfd-9205-29f74d1ddb03","name":"Michel Ray"}],"writers":[{"id":"2b841691-00d9-4000-8175-178fd0bb7d5b","name":"Barney Slater"},{"id":"a2a5cf96-1f78-4742-95c8-e8eeef8974ee","name":"Dudley Nichols"},{"id":"ad12504e-1bb3-4805-ab87-2e84147e2a64","name":"Joel Kane"}],"directors":[{"id":"28f8edaf-9c20-4fc2-914a-da04c15c88cc","name":"Anthony Mann"}]}}

Tall, fashionable, popular airhead big sister is dating him, but fails to truly appreciate the young gentleman, let alone contemplate a serious relationship. Nerdy kid sister Haley hates the waste and expresses her envy by thoughtlessly wishing at a 'shooting star' (comet) to be Alexia. To their stupor, that happens the next morning. Forced to live each-other's lives, but unable to do it well by the other's standards, the sisters soon hate each-other even more and deliberately screw up. Gradually, they realize they would only both lose out, learn to appreciate the other's values and reconsider their own.

In the four years that follow there is no question that rapping has brought Priscilla closer to her estranged father, and that her success has made him proud. Before our eyes, this father-daughter duo go from a one-bedroom shelter in Harlem to a 4 bedroom apartment, from food stamps to shopping sprees, from rapping on street corners to sold out night clubs, and from sneaking under train turnstiles without the $2 fare to spare to being driven around in tinted SUV's. It is further undeniable that Jesse has been reborn, from looking at old photos and bitterly reflecting on how he never was given the respect he deserved in the music business as a rapper himself to finding his own voice and self-respect as his daughter's overzealous manager. But in the efforts to make her dad proud, Priscilla struggles to remain a child and finds herself trapped in a world of people twice her size and four times her age and doesn't know who to trust. Jesse himself is caught between wanting to protect his daughter' innocence and exploiting her raw talent to fulfill his deferred dream.

To smile, to take everything as a joke, to laugh out loud, or to allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by reality. To be painfully aware of the distance between us and our dreams, of the obstacles, and the fact that we are alone all the time. Some choose to escape, to build their own world, with it's own rules, with the memories of fairy tales and dreams that really come to be. A world where three friends are brought together by the same destination. Or maybe, it all comes down to daydreaming. And feeling the empty spaces with music. It all depends on how you choose to see things. In black, in white, or in sync with the beat.

Determined that Astrology has no legitimacy, Jake embarks on a journey to test the theory of Astrology by finding the three people born the same time and place as himself - Sarah Reynolds (Jena Malone), Yvette Montgomery (Brooklyn Sudano) and Wesley Henderson (Max Hartman). The journey quickly uproots Jake from the small college town of Berkeley, California, to downtown Chicago where he sets out to find and interview Sarah, Yvette and Wesley to see if their birthdays proved to be as deplorable as his own. Jake's pursuit in finding his three Astrological matches (or Zodiac twins) will not only test his convictions, but validate how life's unexpected twists of fate can deliver much more than the anticipated. The unforeseen takes Jake from the Windy City, to the boardwalk of New Jersey's Atlantic City, to the bustling streets of New York. What Jake learns along the way is an important lesson about life, love, fate and destiny that will unexpectedly change his life forever.","director":["Danny Buday"],"actors_names":["Cam Gigandet","Derek Shipp","Guy Herbert","Will Yun Lee"],"writers_names":["Danny Buday"],"actors":[{"id":"17bf5adc-1fcd-48e6-943d-9a2c198781d4","name":"Cam Gigandet"},{"id":"3d5c4cd7-7772-4099-a6c3-c1aa06de02fc","name":"Guy Herbert"},{"id":"5509f1e0-d985-4d33-8393-502d95a355fe","name":"Derek Shipp"},{"id":"cfb997e7-9b3b-46c6-ad9d-95056b84c7fd","name":"Will Yun Lee"}],"writers":[{"id":"9d39e6a1-0b39-4c73-af49-3656470a4880","name":"Danny Buday"}],"directors":[{"id":"9d39e6a1-0b39-4c73-af49-3656470a4880","name":"Danny Buday"}]}}

Upon arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover who has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Kamino, and he heads to the remote planet.

Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other, and he has nightmarish visions of his mother. They travel to his home planet, Tatooine, to see his mother, and he discovers that she has been abducted by Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying, and he kills all the Tusken tribe, including the women and children.

Its claim to fame is that it is the star of the MGM feature film The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964). For filming, the automobile traveled from London to northern Italy (Pisa and Florence) to Austria to Yugoslavia, along the way encountering its several co-stars including Rex Harrison and Jeanne Moreau in London, Shirley MacLaine, George C. Scott, Art Carney and Alain Delon in Italy, and Ingrid Bergman and Omar Sharif in Austria and Yugoslavia. The limo also encountered many fans interested both in the filming and the vehicle itself. During filming, the limo was well taken care of by a large maintenance crew. In its post filming life, the limousine has even inspired a fashionable clothing line by designer Joan Leslie in, of course, the famous yellow motif.","director":[],"actors_names":["George C.

There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship's control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her country's ruin, and where Raul's reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castro's supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.","director":["Giammarco Sicuro","Jacopo Cecconi","Paolo Cellammare"],"actors_names":["Giammarco Sicuro","Jacopo Cecconi","Matthew Mercer","Yoani Sanchez"],"writers_names":["Giammarco Sicuro","Jacopo Cecconi","Paolo Cellammare"],"actors":[{"id":"354296e2-12d7-468b-9b67-ed0bcd7dd935","name":"Yoani Sanchez"},{"id":"c2c1ef6b-2267-4a85-9861-1186019f591b","name":"Matthew Mercer"},{"id":"caa357ee-8170-42e1-8da0-c37a62e71e57","name":"Jacopo Cecconi"},{"id":"f7d2e4d4-9895-4c8d-999a-ce0979dcac00","name":"Giammarco Sicuro"}],"writers":[{"id":"6db647d2-5c20-4bde-95a3-65f99674aa46","name":"Paolo Cellammare"},{"id":"caa357ee-8170-42e1-8da0-c37a62e71e57","name":"Jacopo Cecconi"},{"id":"f7d2e4d4-9895-4c8d-999a-ce0979dcac00","name":"Giammarco Sicuro"}],"directors":[{"id":"6db647d2-5c20-4bde-95a3-65f99674aa46","name":"Paolo Cellammare"},{"id":"caa357ee-8170-42e1-8da0-c37a62e71e57","name":"Jacopo Cecconi"},{"id":"f7d2e4d4-9895-4c8d-999a-ce0979dcac00","name":"Giammarco Sicuro"}]}}

Her life is in shambles. She clings to the hope of resurrecting her past movie stardom as a leading ingénue. No one will hire her, she's penniless with creditors selling off anything that she owns that is of monetary value, and she has no one to turn to that can see her through financially. She has in the past supported her sister and brother-in-law, who still want to use her as their meal ticket. Divorced from her actor husband, she shares joint custody of their teen-aged daughter Gretchen, from who Maggie tries to hide her problems. When it looks as if Maggie has hit rock bottom, Jim Johannsen re-enters her life. Jim, who once had the stage name Barry Lester, got his big break in Hollywood movies by Maggie. He came to the quick realization that he was neither good as an actor or that he wanted to do it as a profession. He now works as a boat parts supplier and mechanic. Jim tries to help her come to the realization of the stage of life that she is in to help her reinvent herself. But Maggie wants to regain her star status on her own terms, and does whatever she needs to for that great ingénue role that has eluded her for so many years.","director":["Stuart Heisler"],"actors_names":["Bette Davis","Natalie Wood","Sterling Hayden","Warner Anderson"],"writers_names":["Dale Eunson","Katherine Albert"],"actors":[{"id":"1963a9e9-c2b5-4cfb-ac1b-cfeab32a0bae","name":"Natalie Wood"},{"id":"572a87c2-f21a-416e-822c-332e40cf1433","name":"Bette Davis"},{"id":"c73ee92c-64a6-497d-914e-96ba9f12866b","name":"Sterling Hayden"},{"id":"dbdc70f3-27ce-4286-9ddb-a81791f21efc","name":"Warner Anderson"}],"writers":[{"id":"3981c87f-ba7a-4679-9d7a-22981f2362e4","name":"Dale Eunson"},{"id":"9d91519b-d3a1-4cc3-935e-1b8e779f3780","name":"Katherine Albert"}],"directors":[{"id":"47c2db9b-90d7-4569-84e8-d5c850f7a26a","name":"Stuart Heisler"}]}}

Three cowboys have just bought out a store of items as Christmas presents, despite not having anyone to give the presents to. While two of them admit to wanting to impress the pretty sales clerk, the third just felt good buying gifts to give to someone. Riding through the dark desert on horseback, they see a flashing star off in the distance, which they ride over to investigate. The newly purchased second hand star is a sign just erected by Nick Catapoli for his business, the Star Auto Court. Nick has no Christmas spirit, especially as he deals with the problems of customers, this despite his wife Rosa serving all their customers with a smile and warm heart. He believes most people are hypocrites in that they espouse this spirit at this one time of the year while not having it any other time. As such, he does not want to extend his lobby as shelter for a drifter who just wants to come in from the cold for a little while. Although the drifter tries to explain the true meaning of Christmas to Nick, Nick watching the interactions of all those around him may be a better way to show him, especially when a young and obviously in distress young couple named José and Maria Santos arrive, with no more rooms available at the inn.","director":["Don Siegel"],"actors_names":["Donald Woods","J.
